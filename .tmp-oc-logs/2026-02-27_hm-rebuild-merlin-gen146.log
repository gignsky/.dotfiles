## Home-Manager Rebuild Log - Merlin
**Stardate**: 2026-02-27
**Host**: merlin
**Branch**: fixing-fucked-fonts
**NixOS Generation**: 5 (current)

---

### Rebuild Summary
- **Generation Transition**: 145 → 146
- **Build Duration**: 90 seconds
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Build Type**: home-manager rebuild

---

### Configuration Analysis
**Configuration Files Changed**: None detected
**Files Changed**: No configuration changes detected

---

### Engineering Notes
A clean rebuild with no configuration changes - likely triggered for verification purposes or after a flake input update. The system transitioned smoothly from generation 145 to 146 with a nominal build time of 90 seconds.

This rebuild occurred on the `fixing-fucked-fonts` branch, which suggests we're in active development mode working on font configuration issues. Despite being on a development branch, no configuration changes were detected in this particular rebuild cycle.

**Build Performance**: 90 seconds is well within normal parameters for a home-manager rebuild with no changes. This indicates the Nix evaluation and build cache are functioning properly.

## Home-Manager Rebuild Log - Merlin (Generation 147)
**Stardate**: 2026-02-27
**Host**: merlin
**Branch**: fixing-fucked-fonts
**NixOS Generation**: 5 (current)

---

### Rebuild Summary
- **Generation Transition**: 146 → 147
- **Build Duration**: 13 seconds
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Build Type**: home-manager rebuild

---

### Configuration Analysis
**Configuration Files Changed**: None detected
**Files Changed**: No configuration changes detected

---

### Engineering Notes
Another clean rebuild with no configuration changes detected. This rapid rebuild (only 13 seconds compared to the previous 90 seconds) indicates excellent Nix cache utilization - the system is reusing all previously built derivations.

The significantly faster build time suggests this was either:
1. A verification rebuild after the previous generation 146
2. A rebuild triggered by a minor flake.lock update that didn't affect home-manager outputs
3. A manual rebuild for system verification purposes

Still operating on the `fixing-fucked-fonts` branch. The fact that we're seeing successive rebuilds with no configuration changes suggests we may be testing or verifying the system state before making further font configuration modifications.

**Build Performance**: 13 seconds is exceptional - this indicates the Nix store and binary cache are functioning optimally with full cache hits.
