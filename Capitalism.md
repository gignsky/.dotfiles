**THE WEIGHT OF A LETTER**

---

        First, I ask of you dear reader -- rhetorically, of course -- what distignishes a great man and a Great man?
    Who are -- or perhaps, were these men? Does anyone even remember? Though unforgiving tides of time have washed
    away all that can be remembered,

        Everybody gives money to Mr. Sayjack, after all -- it is America's Game, but the true hero
    -- poeticly is Ms. White, the bearer of the weight of letters.
