ENGINEERING LOG: WezTerm Configuration Enhancement - Merlin
================================================================================
Stardate: 2025-12-08 
Chief Engineer: Montgomery Scott
Host: merlin
Operation: Home Manager Rebuild
Status: SUCCESS

PERFORMANCE METRICS
==================
Generation: 57 → 58
Build Duration: 11 seconds (Excellent performance!)
Configuration Scope: Terminal emulator enhancement

TECHNICAL MODIFICATIONS
=======================
File Modified: home/gig/common/core/wezterm.nix
Change Type: Configuration cleanup and font management preparation

Key Changes:
1. Font Configuration Comments
   - Added commented font configuration examples
   - Prepared fallback font chain: MonoLisa Variable, Cartograph CF, GoMono Nerd Font Mono
   - Individual font selection options preserved as comments

2. Code Structure Improvements
   - Enhanced indentation consistency throughout Lua configuration
   - Maintained existing functional configuration while preparing for future font changes
   - Preserved all existing keybinding configurations (commented)

3. Configuration Preparation
   - Font selection infrastructure ready for quick activation
   - Multiple font options documented for easy switching
   - No functional behavior changes - pure preparation work

ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT
======================
This was a clean configuration enhancement focusing on:
- Future-proofing font selection capabilities
- Code organization and readability improvements
- Maintaining operational stability while preparing for customization

The 11-second build time indicates excellent dependency caching and minimal
rebuild scope - exactly what we want for configuration adjustments.

FLEET IMPLICATIONS
==================
- WezTerm configuration now more maintainable across fleet
- Font selection process standardized and documented
- Ready for individual host customization as needed

TECHNICAL NOTES
===============
No breaking changes introduced. All existing terminal functionality preserved.
Configuration structure now supports rapid font switching for different
environments or user preferences.
