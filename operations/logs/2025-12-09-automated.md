2025-12-09 05:36:49 - MERLIN NIXOS-REBUILD SUCCESS
Host: merlin
Generation: 65 → 66
Build Duration: 26 seconds
Status: SUCCESSFUL

CONFIGURATION CHANGES:
- fonts.nix: Promoted Monolisa Variable to primary monospace font (moved above Cartograph CF)
- merlin/default.nix: Disabled Tailscale service (tailscale.enable = false)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
Files Modified: 2
- hosts/common/core/fonts.nix: Font priority reordering
- hosts/merlin/default.nix: Tailscale service configuration

ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT:
Both changes are non-critical configuration adjustments:
1. Font prioritization change improves typography consistency
2. Tailscale disable suggests network configuration cleanup

Build completed in 26 seconds - excellent performance for this generation increment.
