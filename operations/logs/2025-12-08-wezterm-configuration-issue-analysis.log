ENGINEERING LOG: WezTerm Configuration Issue Analysis - Merlin
================================================================================
Stardate: 2025-12-08T20:10:00-05:00
Chief Engineer: Montgomery Scott
Host: merlin
Operation: Post-Rebuild Issue Documentation
Status: ISSUE IDENTIFIED - NO REPAIRS ATTEMPTED

SITUATION REPORT
================
Following the recent font configuration changes in commit ab9e3d0, home-manager 
rebuild completed successfully (generation 57→58, 11s duration), but analysis 
reveals a configuration syntax error that could cause runtime issues.

TECHNICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
===========================
File: home/gig/common/core/wezterm.nix
Location: Line 16
Issue: Incorrect comment syntax within Lua extraConfig

Current problematic code:
```
extraConfig = ''
    local wezterm = require("wezterm")
    local config = wezterm.config_builder()
    config.font_size = 12.0
  # config.font = "Cartograph CF"    <-- PROBLEM: Nix comment in Lua context
```

Expected fix:
```
  -- config.font = "Cartograph CF"   <-- Proper Lua comment syntax
```

ENGINEERING ANALYSIS
====================
The build succeeded because this is within a quoted string passed to WezTerm's
configuration parser. However, at runtime, this will likely:
1. Cause WezTerm Lua parser to encounter unexpected '#' character
2. Potentially generate terminal errors or fail to load configuration
3. May fall back to default WezTerm settings, losing custom configurations

IMPACT ASSESSMENT
=================
Severity: MODERATE
- Home-manager build: SUCCESS ✓
- Configuration deployment: SUCCESS ✓  
- Runtime behavior: LIKELY DEGRADED ⚠️
- Terminal functionality: MAY BE IMPAIRED ⚠️

BUILD PERFORMANCE METRICS
==========================
- Last rebuild duration: 11s (excellent)
- Generation transition: 57 → 58
- No dependency rebuilds required
- Caching efficiency: Optimal

FLEET IMPLICATIONS
==================
This affects the common WezTerm configuration used across multiple hosts.
Any host rebuilding with this configuration will inherit the same issue.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
==================
Captain's directive received: "Don't attempt to fix things, just document"
Status: DOCUMENTED - NO REPAIR ACTIONS TAKEN

This issue should be addressed in a future configuration update by changing
the Nix comment (#) to a Lua comment (--) on line 16.

TECHNICAL METADATA
==================
Git Commit: ab9e3d0df3fd57fc0919b8ed177c1d2d7adfe647
Branch: merlin-bspwm-config
Working Tree: Clean (issue exists in committed code)
Configuration Scope: Terminal emulator - font selection
