## NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADE REQUIREMENT

**OPERATIONAL CONTEXT**:
Lord Gig has identified the need to reconfigure the fleet's network infrastructure, specifically transitioning from the current Archer router device to utilizing the layer 3 switch as the primary routing device.

**CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT**:
- **Primary Router**: Archer device (current configuration)
- **Available Hardware**: Layer 3 switch (underutilized)
- **Network Topology**: Standard residential/small office setup

**UPGRADE REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED**:

1. **Layer 3 Switch Router Configuration**
   - Configure layer 3 switch to handle primary routing duties
   - Implement DHCP services on the layer 3 switch
   - Set up appropriate firewall rules and security policies
   - Configure VLAN segmentation for network organization

2. **Migration Planning**
   - Assess current Archer device configuration for service migration
   - Plan minimal downtime transition strategy
   - Backup current network configurations
   - Test layer 3 switch capabilities for routing functionality

3. **Expected Benefits**
   - **Enhanced Network Performance**: Layer 3 switches typically offer superior packet processing capabilities
   - **Advanced VLAN Support**: Better network segmentation and traffic management
   - **Improved Management**: More granular control over network routing and policies
   - **Scalability**: Better foundation for future network expansion

**TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS**:
- Verify layer 3 switch routing capabilities and licensing
- Assess power and cooling requirements
- Plan IP addressing scheme and VLAN structure
- Configure management interfaces and monitoring

**PRIORITY ASSESSMENT**: High
This infrastructure upgrade will provide the foundational network improvements needed for the fleet's expanding operations and improved network management capabilities.

**ENGINEERING NOTES**:
The Captain has documented this requirement in the main notes.md file under "NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADE" with appropriate priority designation. The upgrade aligns with the fleet's modernization objectives and will provide better network control for our expanding operations.

**NEXT ACTIONS REQUIRED**:
1. Research layer 3 switch specific configuration requirements
2. Document current Archer device configuration for reference
3. Plan migration timeline and procedures
4. Test layer 3 switch routing capabilities in controlled environment

**STATUS**: Requirement Documented - Awaiting Implementation Planning
