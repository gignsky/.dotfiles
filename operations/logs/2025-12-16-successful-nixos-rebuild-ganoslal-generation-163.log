ENGINEERING LOG - STARDATE 2025-12-16.1
WSL HOST: ganoslal (nixos)
CHIEF ENGINEER: Montgomery Scott

=== NIXOS-REBUILD SUCCESS REPORT ===

BUILD METRICS:
- Generation: 163 → 163 (in-place configuration updates)
- Build Duration: 26 seconds
- Host Target: wsl@ganoslal
- Status: SUCCESSFUL REBUILD

CONFIGURATION CHANGES ANALYSIS:
Total files modified: 15 configuration files across core systems

CRITICAL SYSTEMS UPDATED:
1. Font Infrastructure (flake.nix)
   - Updated fancy-fonts repository reference:
     FROM: git+ssh://git@github.com/gignsky/personal-fonts-nix
     TO:   git+ssh://git@github.com/gignsky/fancy-fonts
   - Maintains nixpkgs-unstable input following

2. OpenCode Agent System Enhancement (opencode.nix)
   - NEW COMMAND: log-status - "Detect and document undocumented system changes"
   - NEW COMMAND: commit - "Standardized git commit workflow with fleet standards compliance"
   - Enhanced documentation tracking capabilities for fleet operations

3. Terminal Environment Improvements:
   a) Starship Configuration (starship.nix)
      - Cleaned up commented preset configurations
      - Maintained Zsh and Nushell integrations

   b) WezTerm Terminal Enhancements (wezterm.nix)
      - Font size increase: 11.0 → 12.0 (improved readability)
      - Font priority reordered: MonoLisa Variable promoted to primary
      - Maintained fallback chain: MonoLisa → Cartograph CF → GoMono Nerd Font

4. NEW MODULE: Bat Configuration (bat.nix)
   - Modern cat replacement with syntax highlighting
   - Optimized pager configuration: "less -RFXig"
   - Style: numbers, changes, header visibility
   - Theme: TwoDark for WSL compatibility
   - Auto-wrapping and color detection

5. Shell Aliases Expansion (shellAliases.nix)
   - NEW: bcat = "bat --paging=always" (forced paging for better reading)
   - NEW: rebuild-test-verified (development branch verification)
   - Enhanced cat → bat redirection

6. Home Manager Package Additions (home.nix):
   - AUDIO STACK: Complete bluetooth headset support
     * bluetuith (TUI bluetooth manager)
     * pwvucontrol (modern PipeWire control)
     * helvum (PipeWire patchbay)
     * playerctl (media control daemon)
     * easyeffects + audio plugins (calf, lsp-plugins)
   - SERVICES: playerctld.enable = true (bluetooth media controls)
   - UTILITIES: libqalculate (scientific calculator replacement)
   - Bat configuration module integration

7. Host-Specific Updates:
   - Merlin: plex-media-player → plex-desktop (desktop application upgrade)
   - Multiple host configuration touchpoints for bluetooth/audio consistency

ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT:
✅ Successful in-place generation update demonstrates stable configuration state
✅ 26-second build time indicates efficient dependency resolution
✅ Major audio infrastructure upgrade for enhanced WSL multimedia capabilities
✅ Font system modernization without breaking existing workflows
✅ Agent command system expanded for improved fleet documentation
✅ Terminal experience improvements for daily operations

OPERATIONAL IMPACT:
- Enhanced multimedia capabilities for ganoslal WSL environment
- Improved terminal readability and user experience
- Expanded agent documentation and tracking capabilities
- Modern audio stack with bluetooth headset optimization
- Cleaner font dependency management

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Test new bluetooth audio stack with OnePlus Buds 3
2. Verify bat pager behavior in various terminal contexts
3. Validate new agent commands (/log-status, /commit) functionality
4. Monitor font rendering with updated WezTerm configuration
5. Test plex-desktop functionality on merlin when available

NEXT ENGINEERING PRIORITIES:
- Verify audio pipeline functionality in WSL environment
- Document bluetooth pairing procedures for new stack
- Test enhanced agent command integration
- Validate font consistency across host fleet
