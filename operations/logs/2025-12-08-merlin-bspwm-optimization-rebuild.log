ENGINEERING LOG - HOME-MANAGER REBUILD SUCCESS
================================================================================
Stardate: 2025-12-08 15:47:22
Host: merlin (Framework 16 - Mobile Engineering Station)
Chief Engineer: Montgomery Scott
Operation: BSPWM Configuration Optimization & Display Manager Standardization

================================================================================
REBUILD METRICS
================================================================================
Generation: 55 → 56 (+1)
Build Duration: 10 seconds (Excellent performance!)
Status: SUCCESS - All systems nominal
Configuration State: Stable

================================================================================
TECHNICAL MODIFICATIONS
================================================================================

**Primary Changes:**
1. BSPWM Window Rules Cleanup (home/gig/common/optional/bspwm.nix)
   - Removed hardcoded VS Code desktop assignments (^3)
   - Eliminated "code"/"Code" window rules
   - Simplified window management for more flexible workspace allocation

2. Monitor Configuration Optimization (home/gig/common/resources/bspwm/merlin.conf)
   - Refined docked desktop distribution strategy
   - Laptop: I-II, VI-X (adjusted for optimal workflow)
   - External: III-V (concentrated secondary workspace)
   - Improved shell formatting and consistency
   - Enhanced configuration comments and documentation

3. Display Manager Standardization (hosts/common/optional/bspwm.nix)
   - Disabled automatic login to bspwm session
   - Commented out forced session selection
   - Restored user choice at login (security improvement)
   - Disabled aggressive animation reduction

ENGINEERING ANALYSIS
================================================================================

**Performance Impact:**
✓ 10-second rebuild time indicates healthy dependency resolution
✓ No evaluation errors or build conflicts detected
✓ Clean configuration state maintained

**Configuration Benefits:**
✓ Eliminated rigid window placement constraints (code → desktop 3)
✓ More flexible workspace management for development workflow
✓ Improved dual-monitor desktop distribution for Framework 16
✓ Better separation of primary development (laptop) and secondary tasks (external)
✓ Restored login flexibility for security and user preference

**Docked vs Portable Workflow Enhancement:**
- Docked: Laptop handles primary development flow with optimized desktop spread
- External monitor dedicated to focused secondary applications (III-V)
- Portable: Standard single-screen distribution maintains full desktop access

================================================================================
FLEET OPERATIONAL NOTES
================================================================================

This rebuild represents a refinement of merlin's mobile engineering capabilities:

1. **Window Management**: Moved away from application-specific desktop forcing
2. **Multi-Monitor**: Optimized for Framework 16 docked/portable duality
3. **Security Posture**: Restored login choice rather than forced auto-login
4. **Development Ergonomics**: Better workspace distribution for coding workflows

The 10-second rebuild time confirms merlin's systems are operating at peak efficiency.
No further intervention required - configuration stable and optimized.
