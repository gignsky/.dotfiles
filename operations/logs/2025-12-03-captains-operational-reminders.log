CAPTAIN'S OPERATIONAL REMINDERS - STARDATE 2025-12-03
================================================================================

PENDING OPERATIONS - HIGH PRIORITY:

1. **GIGVIM UPGRADES - CONTINUATION REQUIRED**
   - Status: Consultation work initiated but incomplete
   - Reference: Mission archive 2025-12-03-gigvim-build-consultation/
   - Action Required: Resume upgrades to gigvim repository
   - Priority: High - active development project

2. **CREW INTEGRATION INTO VIM - NEW INITIATIVE** 
   - Objective: Integrate fleet agents directly into vim environment
   - Scope: Explore vim plugin architecture for agent integration
   - Potential: Direct access to engineering capabilities within editor
   - Research Required: vim plugin development, agent communication protocols
   - Priority: High - innovative fleet capability enhancement

CONTEXT NOTES:
• Both initiatives align with fleet modernization objectives
• gigvim work has existing foundation and mission documentation
• Vim integration represents significant capability enhancement
• Consider coordination between these related development efforts

RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS:
1. Review gigvim consultation mission archive for current status
2. Investigate vim plugin frameworks for agent integration
3. Assess technical feasibility and resource requirements
4. Develop implementation timeline for both projects

ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT:
These initiatives represent substantial engineering projects that could
significantly enhance both the development environment and fleet operational
capabilities. Recommend dedicated engineering time allocation.
