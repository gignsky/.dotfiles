CHIEF ENGINEER'S LOG - STARDATE 2025.11.25 (SITREP IMPLEMENTATION)
================================================================================

ENGINEERING DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION: UNIVERSAL SITREP COMMAND

MISSION OBJECTIVE:
Implement '/sitrep' slash command across all agent configurations to provide
standardized situational awareness while maintaining agent-specific personality.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:
1. SCOTTY AGENT CONFIGURATION:
   • Added '/sitrep' command to YAML frontmatter in scotty-additional-personality.md
   • Defined command description and action parameters
   • Command triggers comprehensive fleet status reporting

2. STANDARDIZED FORMAT CREATION:
   • Established universal sitrep structure with consistent section headers
   • Defined adaptation guidelines for different agent specializations
   • Created template format maintaining agent personality while ensuring consistency

3. DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS:
   • Section headers: Fleet Status, Current Operations, System Health, etc.
   • Agent personality preservation: Each agent maintains unique voice/terminology
   • Actionable intelligence focus: Emphasizes decision-making information
   • Timestamp and signature requirements for all agents

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
• Command Name: '/sitrep'
• Description: "Comprehensive fleet status and engineering situation report"
• Action: Detailed status covering systems, operations, health, metrics, issues, recommendations
• Format: Structured sections with agent-specific adaptations
• Signature: Each agent signs with characteristic closing

FLEET-WIDE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
1. Debug Agents: Focus on error patterns, debugging sessions, resolution statistics
2. Development Agents: Emphasize project status, code quality, feature progress  
3. System Agents: Highlight infrastructure, performance, security status
4. Utility Agents: Show service availability, maintenance schedules, operational metrics

NEXT ENGINEERING PHASES:
• Update AGENTS.md with implementation directive
• Test sitrep command functionality
• Roll out to other agent configurations as they're developed
• Establish sitrep reporting frequency recommendations

ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT:
The '/sitrep' command implementation provides standardized situational awareness
across the entire agent fleet while preserving individual agent characteristics.
This creates a unified reporting framework for comprehensive system oversight.

PREVENTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Regular testing of sitrep command across all agents
• Periodic review of format effectiveness and agent compliance
• Integration testing when new agents are developed
• User feedback collection for format optimization

STATUS: Implementation complete for Scotty agent, ready for fleet-wide deployment
