FLEET STATUS: HOME-MANAGER REBUILD SUCCESS - MERLIN
================================================================================

OPERATION SUMMARY:
Host: merlin
Operation: home-manager rebuild 
Generation: 62 → 63
Build Duration: 11 seconds
Status: SUCCESSFUL
Branch: merlin-bspwm-config

CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS:
• Configuration Files: No changes detected since last rebuild
• System Changes: No configuration modifications identified
• Package Updates: No package updates processed
• Performance: Excellent - 11 second build time indicates healthy cache utilization

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
• Build completed cleanly without errors
• Generation increment successful (62 → 63)
• Fast build time suggests minimal evaluation overhead
• Configuration integrity maintained

ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT:
This was a clean rebuild cycle with no configuration changes, likely triggered
for verification or synchronization purposes. The 11-second build duration is
excellent, indicating:
- Nix store cache is operating efficiently
- No complex re-evaluations required
- System configuration is stable

FLEET SYNCHRONIZATION STATUS:
• merlin: Generation 63 (CURRENT - OPERATIONAL)
• Configuration sync: Confirmed stable
• No immediate maintenance required

RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Continue monitoring for any post-rebuild system behavior
• Configuration appears stable and ready for continued operation
• Build performance metrics within normal operational parameters

OPERATIONAL NOTES:
This successful rebuild on the merlin-bspwm-config branch confirms that our
experimental BSPWM configuration branch is operating reliably. No configuration
changes detected suggests this was a verification rebuild or cache update cycle.

STATUS: MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
Next scheduled maintenance: As needed
Fleet health: EXCELLENT
