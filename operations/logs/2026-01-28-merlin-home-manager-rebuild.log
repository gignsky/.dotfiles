# Home Manager Rebuild Log - USS Merlin
## Stardate: 2026-01-28 07:51:45

**Rebuild Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Host**: merlin
**Generation**: 100 → 101  
**Build Duration**: 12 seconds
**Configuration Changes**: No configuration files changed
**Files Changed**: No configuration changes detected

## Technical Analysis
- Clean rebuild cycle with no configuration drift
- Generation increment indicates successful activation
- Fast build time suggests minimal changes and good cache utilization
- No configuration changes detected - maintenance rebuild or dependency update

## Engineering Notes
This appears to be a maintenance rebuild, possibly triggered by:
- Regular system maintenance cycle
- User-initiated rebuild to test system state
- Dependency cache refresh
- Generation counter verification

The 12-second build time with no configuration changes indicates optimal system performance and proper Nix store utilization.

## Chief Engineer Assessment
USS Merlin's home-manager system operatin' at peak efficiency. No engineering intervention required.
