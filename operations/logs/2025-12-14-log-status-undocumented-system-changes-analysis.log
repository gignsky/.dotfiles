## LOG-STATUS ANALYSIS: Undocumented System Changes Detection
**Date**: 2025-12-14 08:14:26
**Host**: merlin  
**Operation**: log-status (Detect and document undocumented system changes)
**Analysis Type**: Comprehensive system state vs documentation gap assessment

### 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS: Extensive Undocumented NixOS Activity

**MAJOR DOCUMENTATION GAP DETECTED**

#### System State Summary
- **Current NixOS Generation**: 82 (2025-12-14 08:03:08)
- **Current Home-Manager Generation**: 83 (2025-12-14 06:11)
- **Last Documented NixOS Rebuild**: Generation 65→66 (committed 2025-12-14 02:38:45, but rebuild was 2025-12-09)
- **Documentation Gap**: **16 undocumented NixOS generations** (66→82)

#### Undocumented NixOS Generations Analysis
```
UNDOCUMENTED REBUILDS (Critical):
Generation 67-82: ALL UNDOCUMENTED
- Gen 82: 2025-12-14 08:03:08 ← Current (UNDOCUMENTED)
- Gen 81: 2025-12-14 05:43:30 (UNDOCUMENTED)
- Gen 80: 2025-12-14 05:57:10 (UNDOCUMENTED) 
- Gen 79: 2025-12-14 05:56:08 (UNDOCUMENTED)
- Gen 78: 2025-12-14 05:49:30 (UNDOCUMENTED)
- Gen 77: 2025-12-14 05:43:30 (UNDOCUMENTED)
- Gen 76: 2025-12-14 05:49:30 (UNDOCUMENTED)

- Gen 70: 2025-12-14 03:24:57 (UNDOCUMENTED)
- Gen 69: 2025-12-14 02:47:33 (UNDOCUMENTED)
- Gen 68: 2025-12-09 06:30:56 (UNDOCUMENTED)
- Gen 67: Estimated 2025-12-09 (UNDOCUMENTED)
```

**Pattern Analysis**: Intensive rebuild activity suggests development/testing session with multiple rapid iterations. This represents a complete documentation breakdown for system-level changes.

#### Home-Manager Documentation Status
**WELL-DOCUMENTED**: Home-Manager rebuild activity shows excellent documentation:
- Generation 83 (current): ✅ Documented
- Generation 82: ✅ Documented  
- Generation 81: ✅ Documented
- Generation 80-78: ✅ All documented with proper commit tracking

#### Current Working Tree Status
**MINOR UNCOMMITTED CHANGE DETECTED**:
```diff
File: home/gig/common/optional/shellAliases.nix
Change: Added alias: oc = "opencode";
Status: Uncommitted configuration change
Impact: Minor - adds convenience alias for opencode command
```

### 🔍 Analysis Summary

#### Documentation Quality Assessment
- **Home-Manager**: ✅ EXCELLENT - All rebuilds properly documented with generation tracking
- **NixOS System**: ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE - 16 consecutive undocumented generations
- **Working Tree**: ⚠️ MINOR - One uncommitted shell alias addition

#### System Health Indicators  
- **Generation Frequency**: Extremely high (14+ rebuilds in 5 hours on 2025-12-14)
- **Build Pattern**: Rapid iteration suggests active development/testing
- **Version Progression**: Normal incremental progression (no skipped generations)
- **Kernel Updates**: Multiple kernel version transitions (6.12.58 → 6.12.60 → 6.12.61)

#### Recommended Immediate Actions
1. **PRIORITY 1**: Document current NixOS system state and recent configuration changes
2. **PRIORITY 2**: Implement `/fix-log` protocol for NixOS rebuild logging gaps
3. **PRIORITY 3**: Commit pending shell alias change
4. **PRIORITY 4**: Establish monitoring to prevent future documentation gaps

#### Fleet Operations Impact
- **Risk Level**: MODERATE - System operational but documentation continuity broken
- **Compliance**: Major violation of fleet documentation standards
- **Recovery**: Feasible through configuration diff analysis and git history review

### Technical Metadata
- **Host Detection**: merlin (physical host)
- **Analysis Duration**: ~15 minutes comprehensive scan
- **Data Sources**: nixos-rebuild list-generations, home-manager generations, git log, operations/logs/*
- **Scan Scope**: 2025-12-14 full day + historical reference points
- **Discovery Method**: Cross-reference system generations vs documentation logs
