# Fleet Mission Archives

This directory contains permanent records of all away mission detailed work notes, preserving the engineering process and decision-making trail for future reference.

## Structure

```

├── scotty-missions/          # Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott
├── other-agent-missions/     # Future agent mission archives
└── README.md                # This file
```

## Purpose

Unlike temporary staging areas that get cleaned up, these archives preserve:
- Initial reconnaissance notes
- Detailed technical analysis
- Progressive problem-solving steps  
- Complete context for future reference
- Lessons learned during missions

## Usage

- **During Mission**: Agents write detailed progressive notes
- **Mission Complete**: `/beam-out` compiles final report and archives notes
- **Future Reference**: Historical mission context preserved permanently

The mission archives support the fleet's learning and knowledge preservation objectives while keeping active documentation clean and professional.
