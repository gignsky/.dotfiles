# Future Strategic Session - Realm Governance System

**PRIORITY**: High Strategic Planning  
**TIMING**: Post-GitLab Self-Hosted Implementation  
**CLASSIFICATION**: Private Repository Discussion

## Core Concept
Transition from current dotfiles-focused repository to a comprehensive **realm control system** that manages the entire infrastructure and governance framework.

## Discussion Topics for Future Session

### **Formal Realm Governance Structure**
- Constitutional framework for realm operations
- Decision-making hierarchies and processes  
- Officer roles, responsibilities, and authority boundaries
- Conflict resolution and appeals processes

### **Creative Manifesto for Operations**
- Philosophical foundations guiding technical decisions
- Creative principles informing system architecture
- Balance between engineering efficiency and creative exploration
- Documentation standards that preserve both technical and creative insights

### **Philosophical Framework Integration**
- "Realm of Reason" principles embedded in operational practices
- How logical systems can support creative endeavors
- Decision trees for balancing competing priorities
- Long-term vision and values implementation

## Implementation Strategy

### **Repository Architecture Evolution**
- **Current**: Personal dotfiles with fleet operations overlay
- **Future**: Dedicated realm governance repository
- **Scope**: Complete system control beyond individual configurations
- **Privacy**: Self-hosted GitLab for sensitive governance discussions

### **System Integration Requirements**
- Interface with existing dotfiles repository
- Control mechanisms for fleet-wide operations
- Scalability for expanded realm operations
- Security frameworks for sensitive governance data

## Prerequisites
1. ✅ **GitLab Self-Hosted** - Private repository capability
2. **Privacy Architecture** - Secure discussion environment  
3. **Foundational Stability** - Current system fully operational
4. **Strategic Planning Time** - Dedicated session for deep exploration
