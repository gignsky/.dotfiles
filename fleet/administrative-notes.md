# Notes for Future Administrative Support

**Purpose**: Items to revisit when a Yeoman is hired to assist with administrative duties

## Administrative Systems to Consider

### Emergency Escalation Protocols
- Review need for formal escalation paths when realm grows beyond direct communication
- Current structure (direct to Lord Gig) appropriate for current scale
- **Status**: Revisit when fleet size makes direct communication impractical

### Infrastructure Growth Planning
- memory-gamma configuration decisions (TrueNAS vs NixOS)
- memory-beta modernization strategy  
- Layer 3 Switch naming and configuration requirements
- Network segmentation and security zone planning
- **Status**: Evaluate expansion priorities when administrative support available

### Agentic Task Management System
- **Goal**: Enable crew members to work autonomously on assigned features
- **Process**: Discussion → separate branch work → Merge Request upon completion
- **Requirements**: Branch management, task isolation, completion validation
- **Status**: Research implementation approaches when development resources available

### Command & Control Communication System
- **Inbox System**: Receive reports and updates from crew
- **Outbox System**: Write task assignments to files for crew pickup
- **Integration**: Seamless task assignment and status reporting
- **Complexity**: Likely significant undertaking requiring dedicated development time
- **Status**: Major project for future planning when development capacity exists

### Technical Conventions Review
- **Goal**: Review and refine realm's technical conventions and standards
- **Documents**: GIT-CONVENTIONS.md, coding standards, documentation practices
- **Focus**: Ensure conventions scale appropriately with realm growth
- **Personnel**: Requires experienced technical crew member with strong opinions on best practices
- **Status**: Schedule review when suitable technical administrative support available

### Creative Works Discussion
- **Goal**: Schedule discussion with Lord Gig about creative works and their operational implications
- **Documents to Review**:
  - "the-run-on.md" - creative work about endless sentences and literary themes
  - "exchange" - philosophical thoughts that could influence crew operations (requires polishing)
- **Purpose**: Gather crew thoughts, interpretations, and explore how creative works might inform operational practices
- **Format**: Future crew discussion session to explore literary themes, philosophical concepts, and potential operational changes
- **Status**: Awaiting scheduling when administrative support available

### MCP Server Expansion
- **Goal**: Provide crew members with additional tools and capabilities via MCP servers
- **Requirements**: Research available MCP servers, evaluate crew-specific needs
- **Priority**: Enhanced tooling for specialized roles (Security, Communications, Science, Medical)
- **Status**: Investigate options when administrative support can coordinate implementation

## Fleet Specialization Planning
- Security Officer role definition and recruitment criteria
- Communications Officer documentation responsibilities
- Science Officer research and evaluation duties
- Medical Officer monitoring and diagnostics scope
- **Status**: Define roles when administrative support can handle recruitment coordination
