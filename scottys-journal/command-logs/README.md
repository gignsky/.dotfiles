# Command-Level Communication Logs

## Purpose
This directory contains command-level communication logs separate from technical engineering logs. These logs focus on operational decisions, strategic thinking, and command communications rather than technical implementation details.

## Structure

### Technical vs Command Logging
- **Technical Logs** (`scottys-journal/logs/`): Implementation details, debugging, system operations
- **Command Logs** (`scottys-journal/command-logs/`): Strategic decisions, operational planning, command communications

### Log Types

#### Strategic Planning Logs
- Mission planning and strategic decisions
- Resource allocation discussions
- Long-term operational planning

#### Command Communications  
- Fleet coordination and directives
- Cross-repository consultation protocols
- Command-level status reports

#### Operational Reviews
- Mission post-mortems and lessons learned
- Process improvements and workflow updates
- Strategic reassessments

## Naming Convention
`YYYY-MM-DD-[operation-type]-[brief-description].md`

Examples:
- `2025-12-03-strategic-planning-repository-modernization.md`
- `2025-12-03-command-communication-fleet-status-update.md`
- `2025-12-03-operational-review-batched-logging-implementation.md`

## Integration with Technical Logs
Command logs should reference related technical logs when appropriate, but focus on the strategic and operational aspects rather than implementation details.
