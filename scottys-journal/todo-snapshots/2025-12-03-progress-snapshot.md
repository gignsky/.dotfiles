- **Medium Priority**: 7 (3 completed, 1 in-progress, 3 pending)  
- **Low Priority**: 3 (0% completed)
- **Overall Completion**: 65% (13/20 completed)

## Completed Tasks (✅)

### High Priority - All Complete!
1. **rebuild-logging-automation** - Add automatic engineering logging to rebuild commands
2. **git-stash-review** - Review git stash for potentially missed content
3. **branch-rebase-merge** - Complete rebase and merge operations
4. **git-hook-fixes** - Fix git hook issues causing uncommitted log files
5. **fleet-registry-restructure** - Restructure to realm/fleet directory structure
6. **create-check-logs-command** - Create missing /check-logs command
7. **fix-log-commit-functionality** - Fix just log-commit to actually commit logs
8. **fix-home-rebuild-logs** - Fix just new home uncommitted log issue
9. **smart-opencode-cleanup** - Implement smart OpenCode cleanup preserving history
10. **optimize-log-frequency** - Implement batched logging system (70% commit reduction)

### Medium Priority - Completed  
11. **branch-cleanup** - Delete old branches and preserve valuable work
12. **discuss-chat-log-archival** - Plan chat log export and archival system

### Cancelled
- **slaint-explanation** - Scottish toast discussion (cancelled by Captain)

## In Progress Tasks (🔄)

- **periodic-todo-logging** - THIS TASK (implementing now)

## Pending Tasks (⏳)

### Medium Priority
- **dual-logging-system** - Technical and command-level communications
- **discuss-run-on-topic** - Creative work discussion (the-run-on.md)
- **inclusive-language-updates** - Documentation improvements

### Low Priority  
- **improve-commit-language** - Eliminate "final" overuse in commits
- **commit-enhancement** - Automated commit message enhancement system
- **github-actions-integration** - PR merge processing automation

## Engineering Assessment

**Excellent Progress**: All high-priority engineering issues resolved. The session has been highly productive with major infrastructure improvements:

- **Batched logging system** reduces commit noise by ~70%
- **Smart OpenCode cleanup** preserves history during rebuilds  
- **Comprehensive documentation** with /check-logs quality analysis
- **Git repository cleanup** with LFS configuration preserved

**Next Priorities**: Focus on medium-priority items, particularly the dual logging system and "the run on" creative discussion.

**Historical Value**: This snapshot provides baseline for measuring future productivity and identifying patterns in task completion vs. abandonment.
