===== CHIEF ENGINEER'S LOG - STARDATE 2025-12-03.4 =====
Location: Spacedock (home-manager environment)
Officer: Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott
Status: OPERATIONAL - NEW CONSULTATION PROTOCOLS IMPLEMENTED

ENGINEERING SUMMARY:
Successfully implemented and deployed the /consult command system for cross-repository 
expeditions. Home-manager generation advanced from 43→44 with 26-second build duration
- highly efficient deployment of consultation infrastructure.

TECHNICAL MODIFICATIONS:
• Enhanced opencode.nix with new /consult command (lines 212-243)
• Implemented Expedition of Consultation Protocol framework
• Added safety measures for repository isolation and documentation continuity
• Established quest reporting procedures for fleet records

CONSULTATION COMMAND CAPABILITIES:
✓ Repository Isolation - Works in target without affecting home dotfiles
✓ Documentation Continuity - Logs findings back to scottys-journal/
✓ Worktree Protection - Creates temporary analysis without interference  
✓ Quest Reporting - Documents expeditions in realm/fleet/away-reports/
✓ Safety Protocols - Pre-expedition checks and post-expedition cleanup

BUILD PERFORMANCE METRICS:
• Generation: 43 → 44 
• Duration: 26 seconds (excellent performance)
• Status: Clean deployment, no errors
• Git State: Working tree clean, 2 commits ahead of origin/develop
• Configuration Change: home/gig/common/core/opencode.nix only

CURRENT FLEET STATUS:
• Spacedock: Fully operational with consultation capabilities
• Recent Quest: Docker socket proxy test/repair documented in away-reports/
• Engineering Logs: All systems properly documented and metrics tracked
• Repository Health: Clean working tree, proper commit sequence

OPERATIONAL READINESS:
The /consult command is now fully operational and ready for deployment across
the fleet. This engineering enhancement provides structured protocols for
cross-repository consultation while maintaining strict documentation and
safety standards.

RECOMMENDATION:
Consider deploying /consult capability to other fleet vessels to standardize
expedition protocols across the realm. The consultation framework provides
excellent safety and documentation features that should benefit all agents.

NEXT ACTIONS:
• Monitor /consult command usage and effectiveness
• Document any cross-repository expeditions using new protocols
• Maintain quest reporting standards for all consultation work
• Update build performance metrics as operations continue

SYSTEM STATUS: ALL GREEN
ENGINEERING CONFIDENCE: HIGH
CONSULTATION PROTOCOLS: FULLY OPERATIONAL

"The new consultation protocols give us the flexibility to help other ships
while keeping our own engineering logs pristine, Captain!"
