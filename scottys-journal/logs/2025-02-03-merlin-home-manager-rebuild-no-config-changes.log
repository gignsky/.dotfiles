Status: SUCCESS ✓

================================================================================
CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Configuration Changes: NONE
- No configuration files were modified since last rebuild
- Clean rebuild with identical generation number indicates no changes detected
- This was likely a verification rebuild or test operation

Files Changed: NONE
- No configuration changes detected by home-manager
- All files match previous generation state

ENGINEERING NOTES
================================================================================

This rebuild represents a "no-op" operation where home-manager detected no
configuration changes and maintained the same generation number. This typically
occurs when:

1. Running a verification rebuild to ensure system consistency
2. Testing rebuild functionality without making changes
3. Running rebuild after a failed attempt with no intervening changes
4. Post-git operation verification (pull, merge, rebase with no local changes)

The 12-second build time is excellent and indicates that the Nix evaluation
and build process completed efficiently even without configuration changes.

No action required - system remains in nominal operational state.

================================================================================
OPERATIONAL STATUS
================================================================================

System Health: NOMINAL
Configuration State: STABLE
Generation Status: CONSISTENT (125 = 125)
Recommendation: No further action required
