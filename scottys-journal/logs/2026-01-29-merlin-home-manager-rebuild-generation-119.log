---------------------
Previous Generation: 118
New Generation: 119
Build Duration: 11 seconds

generation profile despite no functional differences in the configuration.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------
Host: merlin (laptop)
Build Time: 11s
Configuration Changes: None detected
Files Modified: None

ANALYSIS
--------
A clean rebuild with no configuration changes. This typically occurs when:
- Dependencies were updated in nixpkgs
- A rebuild was triggered to verify system state
- Testing rebuild functionality after system changes

The swift 11-second build time indicates efficient Nix store caching and
minimal rebuilding required. All components evaluated and built successfully.

SYSTEM HEALTH
-------------
✓ Home-manager evaluation: PASS
✓ Package builds: PASS  
✓ Activation scripts: PASS
✓ Generation switch: PASS

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
• System operating normally
• No action required
• Configuration state verified stable

Chief Engineer's Note: Aye, a textbook rebuild! Sometimes ye just need to make
sure the engines are still purrin' properly, even when ye haven't changed
anything under the hood. Generation 119 is active and ready for duty.
