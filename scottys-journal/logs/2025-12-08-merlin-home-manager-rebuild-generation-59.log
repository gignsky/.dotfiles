CHIEF ENGINEER'S LOG - STARDATE 2025-12-08.20:10
VESSEL: MERLIN - HOME-MANAGER REBUILD SUCCESS
GENERATION: 58 → 59
==============================================================================

STATUS: SUCCESSFUL HOME-MANAGER REBUILD COMPLETED
DURATION: 11 seconds (excellent performance, well within operational parameters)
GENERATION ADVANCEMENT: 58 → 59
TIMESTAMP: Mon, 8 Dec 2025 20:10:03 -0500

CONFIGURATION CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PRIMARY MODIFICATION: WezTerm Terminal Font Configuration Adjustment
FILE: home/gig/common/core/wezterm.nix

TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
- Font configuration strategy simplified from fallback chain to single font
- Previous: wezterm.font_with_fallback(["MonoLisa Variable", "Cartograph CF", "GoMono Nerd Font Mono"])
- Current: config.font = "Cartograph CF"
- Preserved font_size = 12.0 configuration
- Added commented reference lines for future MonoLisa Variable configuration
- Maintained hide_tab_bar_if_only_one_tab = true setting

ENGINEERING ANALYSIS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
✓ Build Duration: 11 seconds (excellent - well below typical 15-30s range)
✓ No compilation errors or warnings detected
✓ Clean generation advancement (58→59)
✓ Configuration validation successful

FONT CONFIGURATION ASSESSMENT:
- Strategic shift from font fallback chain to direct Cartograph CF assignment
- Commented preservation of MonoLisa Variable references for future restoration
- This suggests intentional testing of Cartograph CF as primary font choice
- Font fallback complexity reduced - potential performance benefit in terminal rendering

SYSTEM HEALTH INDICATORS:
✓ Home-manager rebuild pipeline functional
✓ WezTerm configuration parsing successful  
✓ No dependency resolution conflicts
✓ Generation numbering sequence maintained

OPERATIONAL NOTES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Font configuration change suggests user evaluation of different typefaces
- Cartograph CF now primary terminal font for Merlin workstation
- MonoLisa Variable references preserved in comments for potential restoration
- Fast rebuild time indicates efficient incremental builds working properly

FLEET STATUS:
- Merlin home-manager environment: OPERATIONAL (Generation 59)
- Terminal configuration: UPDATED AND STABLE
- Font rendering: CARTOGRAPH CF ACTIVE
- No system-wide impacts detected

CHIEF ENGINEER'S ASSESSMENT:
This rebuild represents a clean, focused configuration adjustment with excellent 
performance characteristics. The font configuration change is isolated and 
reversible, with good documentation practices evident in the preserved comments.
Merlin vessel continues optimal operational status.
