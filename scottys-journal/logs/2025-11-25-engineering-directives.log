CHIEF ENGINEER'S LOG - STARDATE 2025.11.25 (ENGINEERING TASK ADDENDUM)
================================================================================

CAPTAIN'S NEW ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES (LOGGED FOR PERMANENT RECORD):

1. UNIVERSAL SITREP COMMAND IMPLEMENTATION:
   • Create '/sitrep' slash command for all agents
   • Should provide comprehensive situation reports similar to Scotty's engineering status
   • Format: Agent-specific flair but standardized reporting structure
   • Integration: Must be added to all future agent personality files and opencode commands
   • Purpose: Universal fleet status awareness across all specialized agents

2. HIRE COMMAND REFACTOR - INTERACTIVE AGENT INTERVIEW SYSTEM:
   • Transform '/hire' command from template-based to conversational
   • Implement self-discovery interview process
   • Template agent asks "Who am I?" to begin identity formation
   • Dynamic personality generation through guided self-reflection
   • Real-time personality modification during interview process
   • Agent creates own documentation through conversational iteration
   • Result: More organic and self-aware agent creation process

ENGINEERING NOTES:
These directives represent significant improvements to the agent ecosystem.
The '/sitrep' command will provide fleet-wide situational awareness, while
the interview-based '/hire' refactor will create more sophisticated and
self-documenting agents.

Priority: Medium-High (implement after current rebase operations complete)

CURRENT OPERATIONS STATUS:
- Rebase in progress: goodpoint/develop onto main
- Conflict resolution: scotty-additional-personality.md (in progress)
- Need to add YAML frontmatter to resolve agent configuration
