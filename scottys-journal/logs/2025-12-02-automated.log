test-build completed in 15s (success: true, generation: 42)

[2025-12-02 21:40:47] ★ CAPTAIN'S REPORT ★ LOG CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
Successfully implemented Captain's report classification system for Scotty's engineering logs.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
• Enhanced create_narrative_entry() function with classification parameter
• Added display_captain_report() function with bat integration 
• Updated scotty_log_event() to classify build events as reports
• Fixed journal directory path resolution for flexible repo locations
• Added prominent visual formatting for Captain's reports (★ markers)

OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS:
• Engineering notes: Implementation details, debugging steps, personal reminders
• Captain's reports: Build results, fleet status, security assessments, critical alerts
• Auto-display: All reports automatically displayed with bat syntax highlighting
• Terminal detection: Only displays when stdout is terminal (no log spam)
• Fallback display: Uses cat if bat unavailable

INTEGRATION STATUS:
• Rebuild scripts already using enhanced logging functions
• Pre-commit hooks successfully processed all changes
• Journal directory path logic supports both standard and development locations  
• Visual markers (★ CAPTAIN'S REPORT ★) clearly identify command-attention items

NEXT ENGINEERING PHASE:
Ready to proceed with automated commit message enhancement system:
• Custom commit standards based on conventional commits
• Pre-merge git hooks for automatic message enhancement
• GitHub Actions integration for PR merge processing
• Scotty signature system for enhanced commit attribution

[2025-12-02 21:45:03] GIT PUSH PREPARATION
