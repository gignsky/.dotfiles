HOME-MANAGER REBUILD LOG - MERLIN
================================================================================
Stardate: 2026-02-03
Host: merlin
Operation: home-manager rebuild (Generation 123 → 124)
Build Duration: 12 seconds
Branch: recruitment/library-computer
NixOS Generation: 25.11.20251223.76701a1 (Xantusia)

================================================================================
OPERATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

Successful home-manager rebuild on merlin with WezTerm configuration cleanup.
Removed commented-out legacy font configuration that was no longer needed.

Build Performance:
  - Generation increment: 123 → 124
  - Build time: 12 seconds (excellent performance)
  - Status: SUCCESS ✓

================================================================================
CONFIGURATION CHANGES
================================================================================

Modified Files:
  • home/gig/common/core/wezterm.nix

Changes Applied:
  - Removed commented-out "old config" block (7 lines)
  - Cleaned up legacy TODO comment about lazygit font configuration
  - Retained active font configuration with MonoLisa Mono fallback chain
  - Maintained font_size = 15.0 setting

Technical Details:
  The removed code was a commented-out legacy configuration block that
  referenced the old font setup with MonoLisa Variable, Cartograph CF, and
  GoMono Nerd Font Mono. This cleanup improves code readability without
  affecting active configuration.

ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Status: NOMINAL ✓

This was a straightforward maintenance operation - removing dead code that
was cluttering the configuration. The commented-out block had served its
purpose as reference material but was no longer needed.

Build Performance Notes:
  - 12-second rebuild time indicates minimal dependency chain impact
  - Generation increment confirms successful activation
  - No warnings or errors during build process

Configuration Impact:
  - No functional changes to active WezTerm behavior
  - Improved code readability and maintainability
  - Removed TODO comment that was no longer relevant

Recommendations:
  - Configuration is clean and maintainable
  - If lazygit font configuration still needs attention, consider creating
    a separate TODO or SEP document rather than inline comments
  - Current font fallback chain appears well-configured

CHIEF ENGINEER'S NOTES
================================================================================

A wee bit of spring cleaning never hurt anybody! That commented-out code was
just takin' up space in the dilithium chamber. The active configuration is
solid, and the 12-second rebuild shows we're not triggerin' any unnecessary
rebuilds of larger packages.

If ye need to revisit the font configuration for lazygit specifically, I'd
recommend creatin' a proper engineering protocol document rather than leavin'
TODO comments scattered about. Keep the configuration files clean and let the
proper documentation systems handle the task tracking.

The engines are purrin' like a kitten, Captain!
