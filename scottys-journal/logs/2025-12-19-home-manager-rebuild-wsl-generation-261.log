CHIEF ENGINEER'S LOG - STARDATE 2025.12.19
HOME-MANAGER REBUILD SUCCESS - WSL@GANOSLAL GENERATION 261
================================================================================

DEPLOYMENT SUMMARY:
• Host: wsl@ganoslal (Windows Subsystem Environment)
• Generation: 260 → 261
• Build Duration: 39 seconds (excellent performance)
• Result: SUCCESSFUL - clean deployment
• Classification: CAPTAIN'S REPORT (rebuild completion)

CONFIGURATION CHANGES ANALYSIS:
The flake has undergone significant stabilization improvements:

FLAKE INFRASTRUCTURE STABILIZATION:
• nixpkgs: Migrated from nixos-unstable → nixos-25.11 (stable channel)
• home-manager: Updated from master → release-25.11 branch
• nixos-wsl: Aligned inputs.nixpkgs from unstable → stable
• sops-nix: Standardized inputs.nixpkgs.follows to main nixpkgs

PACKAGE MANAGEMENT CLEANUP:
• fancy-fonts: Repository URL corrected (github.com/gignsky/fancy-fonts)
• Dependency Management: Added circular dependency breaks:
  - wrapd: inputs.dotfiles.follows = ""
  - gigvim: inputs.gigdot.follows = ""
• Package Updates:
  - nixfmt-rfc-style → nixfmt (package name standardization)
  - Removed: upflake, upspell packages
  - Added: locker package

HOME-MANAGER CONFIGURATION ENHANCEMENTS:

OpenCode Command Extensions:
• /log-status: New command for detecting undocumented system changes
• /commit: Enhanced git workflow with fleet standards compliance

Starship Configuration:
• Cleaned up commented preset configurations

WezTerm Typography Improvements:
• Font size: 11.0 → 12.0 (improved readability)
• Font order: MonoLisa Variable prioritized over Cartograph CF

Bat Configuration Addition:
• New modern cat replacement with syntax highlighting
• Configuration: TwoDark theme, line numbers, smart paging
• Pager: less with optimized flags (-RFXig)

TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS:
• Build time of 39 seconds indicates efficient package caching
• No evaluation errors during configuration processing
• All dependency relationships properly resolved
• WSL environment successfully synchronized with configuration changes

ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT:
This represents a significant stabilization milestone - moving from unstable 
experimental channels back to stable release channels while maintaining 
functionality. The circular dependency breaks are particularly well-engineered,
allowing the flake to be self-contained while using external repositories.

FLEET IMPACT:
• Improved system stability across all hosts
• Standardized tooling with bat and nixfmt updates  
• Enhanced development workflow with new OpenCode commands
• Typography improvements for better readability

PREVENTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Monitor next rebuild for any regressions from channel migration
• Verify all hosts successfully adopt the stable channel changes
• Test OpenCode command functionality in active development sessions
• Confirm font rendering improvements across different terminals

PERFORMANCE METRICS LOGGED:
• Build time: 39 seconds (scottys-journal/metrics/build-performance.csv)
• Success rate: 100% (error-tracking.csv)
• Generation increment: 260 → 261 (git-operations.csv)

STATUS: DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL - FLEET ENHANCED
