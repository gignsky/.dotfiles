[2025-12-08 18:06:43] 🔧 ENGINEERING DETAILED ANALYSIS - GENERATION 41→42
Configuration Changes Applied:
  • flake.nix: Corrected fancy-fonts repository URL (personal-fonts-nix → fancy-fonts)
  • opencode.nix: Added 'log-status' and 'commit' command implementations
  • shellAliases.nix: Added rebuild-test-verified alias for verification testing
  • home.nix: Integrated libqalculate package (scientific calculator replacement)
  • hosts/common/users/gig/default.nix: Code quality improvement (gid assignment)
  • hosts/wsl/default.nix: WSL-specific user ID override (uid=1000, gid=1701)
  • vars/default.nix: Fixed typo (guid → gid) in variable naming

Technical Metrics:
  • Build Duration: 15 seconds (Generation 41→42)
  • Platform: WSL@merlins-windows (nixos hostname)
  • Configuration Files Modified: 7 core system files
  • User ID Configuration: Specialized WSL UID override implemented
  • Package Additions: Scientific calculator (libqalculate) for Windows Calculator replacement

Engineering Assessment: Clean, efficient rebuild with comprehensive system improvements.
Font repository correction eliminates potential dependency issues.
WSL-specific user configuration properly handles Windows/Linux ID mapping.
Agent command enhancements provide improved operational capabilities.
