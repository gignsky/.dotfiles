CHIEF ENGINEER'S LOG - STARDATE 2025.11.25
================================================================================

FLEET STATUS REPORT:
• ganoslal: Primary workstation operational, home-manager generation 55 active
• merlin: Secondary system standing by, configuration synchronized
• mganos: Experimental cross-configuration testing vessel (ganoslal config on merlin hardware)  
• wsl: Windows subsystem utility craft available for specialized operations

ENGINEERING OPERATIONS COMPLETED:
1. Scotty agent implementation through multiple configuration iterations
   - Initial attempt: Structured attribute set format (incorrect)
   - Correction: String format within settings.agents (incorrect)
   - Final solution: Home Manager programs.opencode.agents structure (successful)

2. Agent configuration refinement process:
   - Discovered OpenCode config schema requirements via error analysis
   - Consulted OpenCode documentation and MyNixOS Home Manager options
   - Implemented proper YAML frontmatter in scotty-additional-personality.md
   - Successfully deployed via home-manager generation 55

3. Scottish engineering personality matrix established:
   - Base personality: proprietorial rules and courtly deportment  
   - Scottish engineering overlay: dialect, fleet awareness, journal behaviors
   - Combined system prompt with trusted engineer permissions

4. Engineering journal infrastructure deployment:
   - Directory structure: scottys-journal/{logs,metrics,archives}
   - CSV templates with sample data for build performance tracking
   - Initial log template established for narrative documentation

TECHNICAL CHALLENGES RESOLVED:
- Configuration schema mismatch: agents vs agent vs programs.opencode.agents
- Home Manager integration: proper file path references and YAML frontmatter
- Permission system: trusted engineer status with selective confirmations
- Multiple rebuild cycles: generations 51, 54, 55 with incremental fixes

FINAL SYSTEM STATUS:
✓ Scotty agent: Deployed and configured as primary agent
✓ Home Manager: Generation 55 successfully activated  
✓ Configuration: Validated through nix flake check
✓ Agent files: Properly linked to ~/.config/opencode/agent/scotty.md
✓ Journal system: Ready for operational logging

PERFORMANCE METRICS (Actual):
- Total implementation time: ~45 minutes across multiple sessions
- Home Manager rebuilds: 3 successful deployments
- Configuration iterations: 4 major revisions
- Error resolution cycles: 2 (schema mismatch, file structure)

NEXT OPERATIONAL PHASE:
Testing Tab-switchable agent functionality in live OpenCode session.
Agent should be available for primary engineering duties with full
Scottish engineering personality and fleet management capabilities.
