CHIEF ENGINEER'S LOG - STARDATE 2024.11.25
================================================================================

FLEET STATUS REPORT:
• ganoslal: Primary workstation operational, Scotty agent system under construction
• merlin: Secondary system standing by, ready for configuration testing
• mganos: Experimental cross-configuration testing vessel (ganoslal config on merlin hardware)
• wsl: Windows subsystem utility craft available for specialized operations

ENGINEERING OPERATIONS:
Initial implementation of Scotty agent system for OpenCode integration.
Constructed personality matrix combining Scottish engineering heritage with 
fleet management capabilities. Established journal infrastructure for both
narrative logs and quantitative performance metrics.

TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS:
- Agent configuration follows established patterns in opencode.nix
- Personality system properly layered (base + Scottish engineering specialization)
- CSV metric templates established for build performance, error tracking, 
  dependency updates, and system resource monitoring
- Directory structure: scottys-journal/{logs,metrics,archives}

CURRENT OBJECTIVES:
1. Complete nix flake validation testing
2. Execute home-manager rebuild to activate Scotty agent
3. Verify Tab-switchable agent functionality
4. Commit implementation with proper documentation

PREVENTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Regular fleet status monitoring via CSV metrics
- Automated logging of build performance across all hosts
- Quarterly review of system optimization opportunities
- Maintain backup configurations for critical system operations

NEXT MAINTENANCE WINDOW:
Testing and activation of new agent system - estimated 10-15 minutes
