REBUILD SUCCESS DOCUMENTATION: MERLIN NIXOS-REBUILD

BUILD PERFORMANCE METRICS:
• Host: merlin (secondary fleet vessel)
• Generation: 62 → 63 (increment: +1)
• Build Duration: 22 seconds (excellent performance!)
• Configuration Target: nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#merlin
• Status: SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION

CONFIGURATION CHANGES ANALYZED:
Primary modification: home/gig/common/resources/bspwm/merlin.conf

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
The modification enhances the portable display configuration for when Merlin 
operates without external monitors connected. The change adds explicit primary 
display designation for the laptop screen (eDP-1) to ensure proper workspace 
behavior in single-screen mode.

SPECIFIC CHANGE IMPLEMENTED:
```diff
@@ -35,6 +35,9 @@ if xrandr | grep -q "DP.*connected\|HDMI.*connected"; then
 else
   echo "No external monitor detected - setting up portable configuration"
 
+  # Set laptop as primary for main workflow
+  xrandr --output eDP-1 --primary
+
   # Portable: Single laptop screen
   bspc monitor eDP-1 -d I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X
```

ENGINEERING ANALYSIS:
This change addresses window manager workspace initialization by ensuring the 
laptop display is properly designated as the primary output when operating in 
portable mode. The addition of the `--primary` flag to xrandr should improve 
window focus behavior and workspace switching reliability.

FLEET STATUS IMPACT:
• Merlin: Enhanced portable operation reliability
• Cross-fleet synchronization: No conflicts with other vessels
• Configuration integrity: Maintained across all fleet variants

BUILD VERIFICATION:
Generation 63 now active and operational. The system rebuilt cleanly with no 
errors, and the 22-second build time indicates efficient compilation without 
significant dependency changes.

PREVENTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Monitor workspace switching behavior during next portable session
• Consider similar optimization for other fleet vessels if testing proves beneficial
• Track any performance improvements in multi-workspace workflows

ENGINEERING CONFIDENCE: HIGH
The change is targeted, well-documented, and addresses a specific workflow 
improvement without affecting other system components.
