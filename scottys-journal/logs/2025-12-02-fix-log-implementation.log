CHIEF ENGINEER'S LOG - STARDATE 2025.12.02 (FIX-LOG COMMAND IMPLEMENTATION)
================================================================================

LOG INTEGRITY ANALYSIS - ENGINEERING DOCUMENTATION REPAIR

CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT:
The engineering logs show a significant gap from 2025.11.25 to 2025.12.02, representing
a week of undocumented fleet operations. Recent git history indicates:
• spacedock host rebuild activity (current session)
• flake.lock updates occurring without documented engineering oversight
• No recent journal entries documenting system state or modifications

MISSING DOCUMENTATION IDENTIFIED:
1. FLEET STATUS TRANSITIONS:
   • Movement from ganoslal to spacedock operations
   • System configuration changes between November 25 and December 2
   • Home-manager generation transitions not documented

2. UNDOCUMENTED SYSTEM CHANGES:
   • flake.lock update (commit 32a78ac) - no engineering assessment recorded
   • Home-manager generation deployment on spacedock
   • Current host operational status and configuration verification

3. ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES:
   • Captain's request for '/fix-log' universal command implementation
   • No documentation of implementation strategy or technical specifications
   • Missing analysis of how this fits into fleet-wide documentation standards

LOG REPAIR ACTIONS:
1. DOCUMENTING CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
   • Added '/fix-log' command to scotty-additional-personality.md
   • Updated AGENTS.md with universal command requirements
   • Created comprehensive implementation guidelines

2. FLEET STATUS DOCUMENTATION:
   • Current host: spacedock (WSL environment)
   • Recent activity: home-manager generation 40 deployed
   • System appears operational with standard dotfiles configuration

3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
   • Command Name: '/fix-log'
   • Description: "Analyze current state and fix missing log documentation"
   • Action: Assess host/domain state, identify log gaps, document missing information
   • Implementation: State analysis → Gap identification → Documentation repair → Commit

DOCUMENTATION STANDARD VERIFICATION:
• Engineering journal structure maintained in proper format
• Chronological gap identified and addressed with this entry
• Implementation details recorded for future reference
• Universal agent pattern established for fleet-wide deployment

ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT:
The '/fix-log' command addresses a critical operational need - maintaining
accurate documentation when agents haven't been logging properly or when
significant changes occur outside of logged operations. This ensures our
engineering records remain complete and accurate.

PREVENTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Implement regular '/fix-log' audits to prevent documentation gaps
• Establish protocol for major system changes to trigger automatic logging
• Create checkpoints for cross-host transitions to ensure continuity
• Regular fleet-wide documentation integrity verification

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
• Scotty agent '/fix-log' command: OPERATIONAL
• Universal agent pattern: DOCUMENTED
• First successful fix-log execution: COMPLETED
• Fleet deployment readiness: ACHIEVED

NEXT ENGINEERING PHASES:
• Test '/fix-log' command with other agents as they're developed
• Establish recommended frequency for integrity audits
• Create automation hooks for major system changes
• Monitor effectiveness and refine process based on operational experience

ADDITIONAL FLEET OPERATIONS (from worktree cleanup):
[2025-12-02 16:10:40] UNKNOWN EVENT
git-push-prep: Preparing to push branch: goodpoint/develop

[2025-12-02 16:14:43] UNKNOWN EVENT
home-manager-rebuild-success: spacedock: Gen 41→42, 32s build time. Flake optimization complete - separated checks for faster CI/local rebuilds. Modified files: flake.nix (restructured checks), opencode.nix, shellAliases.nix

WORKTREE CLEANUP OPERATIONS:
• Identified invalid worktrees/main/ and worktrees/main-bak/ directories
• Incorporated journal content from worktree into main repository
• Preparing to remove defunct worktree directories
• Git worktree references require cleanup
