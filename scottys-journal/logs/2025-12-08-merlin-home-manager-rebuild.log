REBUILD STATUS REPORT - MERLIN STATION

OPERATION SUMMARY:
Captain reported successful home-manager rebuild completion on merlin station.
Generation transition: 62 → 62 (no generation increment - clean rebuild)
Build duration: 9 seconds (excellent performance within nominal parameters)

CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS:
• No configuration files changed since last rebuild
• No configuration changes detected in system scan
• Clean rebuild indicates stable configuration state
• Generation number unchanged suggests in-place rebuild or configuration validation

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
• Build Time: 9 seconds (well within acceptable parameters)
• Status: SUCCESS
• Host: merlin (secondary support vessel)
• Operation Type: home-manager rebuild
• Configuration Drift: NONE DETECTED

TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS:
This represents a routine maintenance cycle with no active configuration changes.
The rapid build time (9 seconds) indicates:
- Efficient Nix store cache utilization
- No new package compilations required
- Minimal configuration processing overhead
- Healthy system state on merlin station

FLEET IMPLICATIONS:
• Merlin station maintaining stable operational configuration
• No synchronization issues with main dotfiles repository
• Clean rebuild confirms configuration integrity
• Ready for future configuration updates when required

ENGINEERING RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Continue periodic clean rebuilds to verify configuration stability
• Monitor for any configuration drift in future rebuild cycles
• Maintain current update cadence for optimal fleet synchronization

NEXT ACTIONS:
• No immediate action required
• Standard monitoring protocols in effect
• Configuration remains synchronized across fleet
