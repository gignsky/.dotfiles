====================================================================
Subject: RUMDL Issue - DevShell Investigation Discovery
Status: CRITICAL DEBUGGING INTELLIGENCE
Branch: fixing/rumdl
====================================================================

CAPTAIN'S INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING:
------------------------------
The Captain has provided crucial intelligence regarding the ongoing rumdl 
issue investigation. Based on troubleshooting analysis, the root cause is 
believed to be located in the devShell configuration rather than in the 
home-manager or NixOS system configurations.

TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT:
-------------------
- Issue Location: devShell (likely in flake.nix or related dev environment)
- Ruled Out: home-manager configurations
- Ruled Out: NixOS system configurations
- Investigation Focus: Development shell environment setup

ENGINEERING NOTES:
-----------------
This narrows our debugging scope significantly. When resuming work on this
issue, priority should be given to:

1. Examining devShell definitions in flake.nix
2. Checking development dependencies and their versions
3. Reviewing shell hooks and environment variables
4. Validating package availability in development context

NEXT MISSION PARAMETERS:
-----------------------
When Captain returns to address this issue:
- Focus investigation on devShell configurations
- Skip re-testing home-manager and system configs
- Look for package conflicts or missing dependencies in dev environment
- Check if rumdl requires specific runtime environment that devShell lacks

STATUS: Intelligence logged and ready for future mission continuation.
