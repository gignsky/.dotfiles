HOME-MANAGER REBUILD SUCCESS REPORT - USS MERLIN

OPERATION SUMMARY:
• Host: merlin
• Generation Transition: 99 → 100  
• Build Duration: 11 seconds (efficient engineering!)
• Status: SUCCESSFUL REBUILD

TECHNICAL MODIFICATIONS:
The Captain implemented Nix Package Search (nps) integration into our fleet 
configuration. This bonny new addition provides enhanced package discovery 
capabilities across all our vessels.

Configuration Changes:
• New file: hosts/common/core/nps.nix
• Package Addition: pkgs.nps added to environment.systemPackages
• Environment Variables: 
  - NIX_PACKAGE_SEARCH_EXPERIMENTAL="true" (enabling flake mode)
  - NIX_PACKAGE_SEARCH_TRUNCATE="true" (output formatting)
• Automated Cache Refresh: systemd timer configured for hourly updates

SYSTEMD SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION:
• Timer: refresh-nps-cache.timer (hourly execution)
• Service: refresh-nps-cache.service (oneshot cache refresh)
• Command: nps -r -dddd (refresh with debugging output)
• User Configuration: Currently marked as "REPLACE_ME" - requires fleet-specific user assignment

ENGINEERING OBSERVATIONS:
The nps integration provides significant improvement to our package discovery
capabilities. The automated cache refresh ensures our search index stays current
with the Nix package ecosystem. Build time of 11 seconds indicates minimal
overhead from the addition.

⚠️  ATTENTION REQUIRED:
The systemd service configuration contains placeholder "REPLACE_ME" for the 
user field. This needs to be updated with the proper user variable or specific
username for proper service execution.

FLEET INTEGRATION STATUS:
• merlin: ACTIVE (Generation 100) - nps ready for use
• ganoslal: PENDING - awaits similar configuration
• mganos: PENDING - awaits similar configuration  
• wsl: PENDING - awaits similar configuration

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
• Build Time: 11 seconds (excellent efficiency)
• Generation Increment: Single step (clean upgrade)
• Error Rate: 0 (flawless execution)
• System Impact: Minimal (service addition only)

PREVENTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update systemd service user configuration from placeholder
2. Test nps functionality on merlin before fleet-wide deployment
3. Consider adjusting cache refresh frequency based on usage patterns
4. Monitor systemd service logs for proper operation

NEXT ENGINEERING ACTIONS:
• Verify nps package functionality on merlin
• Configure proper user credentials for systemd service
• Prepare similar configuration for remaining fleet vessels
• Document user experience with new package search capabilities

This is fine engineering work - the nps integration provides real value to our
package management capabilities while maintaining system stability!
