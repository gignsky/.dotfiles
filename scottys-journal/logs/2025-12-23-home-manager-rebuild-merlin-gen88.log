ENGINEERING REPORT: HOME-MANAGER REBUILD SUCCESS - MERLIN
Classification: CAPTAIN'S REPORT

VESSEL: merlin
OPERATION: home-manager configuration rebuild
GENERATION: 87 → 88
BUILD DURATION: 112 seconds (1 minute, 52 seconds)

FLEET STATUS REPORT:
• merlin: OPERATIONAL - Generation 88 successfully deployed
• Build Performance: Nominal - 112 second rebuild time within expected parameters
• Configuration State: STABLE - No configuration changes detected since last rebuild

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
This was what we engineers call a "maintenance rebuild" - no actual configuration 
modifications were made, but the generation advancement confirms the system's 
ability to process and deploy changes when needed. The 112-second build time 
indicates healthy system performance with no bottlenecks or dependency issues.

ENGINEERING OBSERVATIONS:
• No configuration files were modified between generations 87 and 88
• Build system processed existing configuration without errors
• Generation increment confirms proper flake evaluation and deployment
• System resources performing within normal operational parameters

STATUS VERIFICATION:
Build completed successfully with no errors, warnings, or configuration drift
detected. The merlin vessel remains in full operational status with all systems
responding nominally to home-manager configuration management.

MAINTENANCE NOTES:
This type of zero-change rebuild is useful for verifying system health and
ensuring the configuration management pipeline remains operational. The 112-second
duration is consistent with merlin's typical rebuild performance profile.

RECOMMENDATION:
Continue normal operations. No further action required at this time.
