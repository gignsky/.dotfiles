CHIEF ENGINEER'S LOG - STARDATE 2025.11.25 (REBASE COMPLETION & PROTOCOL UPDATE)
================================================================================

MAJOR ENGINEERING OPERATIONS COMPLETED:

1. SUCCESSFUL BRANCH REBASE OPERATION:
   • goodpoint/develop rebased onto main branch
   • 20 commits successfully integrated
   • 3 major conflict sets resolved:
     - opencode.nix: Merged agent config with enhanced rules
     - personality.md: Combined personality systems  
     - scotty-additional-personality.md: Resolved path conflicts
   • Default agent configuration preserved
   • All logging system enhancements intact

2. ENGINEERING DOCUMENTATION PROTOCOL ESTABLISHED:
   • Added strict commit discipline to personality matrix
   • Engineering directives immediately logged to permanent files
   • Auto-commit behavior for all engineering notes implemented
   • No data loss policy - all important information preserved

3. CAPTAIN'S ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES LOGGED:
   • /sitrep command: Universal situation report for all agents
   • /hire refactor: Interactive interview-based agent creation
   • Both directives committed to permanent engineering record

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Fleet now operates on unified branch specifications
- Agent personality files properly configured with YAML frontmatter
- Pre-commit hooks functioning correctly with auto-formatting
- Engineering logs automatically preserved and version controlled

PROCEDURAL IMPROVEMENTS:
Enhanced engineering discipline ensures all work is properly documented
and committed to the ship's permanent records. No more session memory
dependency - everything goes to the engineering journal files.

CURRENT FLEET STATUS:
All systems operational. goodpoint/develop branch ready for force-push
to develop once Captain resolves remaining issues.
