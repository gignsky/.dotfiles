scotty "remember something for me, two things actually; first, that the plan is to stabilize this branch and then eventually use it to force push itself onto the develop branch, and then after insuring stability across hosts, it will be released to main -- while periodically pulling in updates from main (like notes contributions). Secondly, before I make the stable merges we need to resolve the scripts as packages thing we did at one point, the package maker doesn't work as expected and frankly my nix flake show is just a little messy with unused script binaries that don't quite work. I do NOT however want to work on this now, but I would like to place the illness on you to remind me when the time is right to do this before reckless changes are made. Thank you Chief!"
