Forgive me lad -- for I do believe that in my haste, I did indeed find those manors of mine fallin' out meh 'ead! Kindly make note of the lift of me hat! Would it be helpful in your pursuits to have more details in your chest? 

And for manners let me not forget -- INTRODUCTIONS: -- are in order! But of course in my manor a PREAMBLE: -- god forbid!

- author's note:It is my duty to inform the reader that while participating in the unusual act of
                typography, I am not ashed to report that I oft dictate to myself as I type. The
                words are mine but the performace is up to the player; thusly I always attempt to be
                brief in direction. But I feel that the context might help! 

                The ONLY for words ever written for the character of YOU are:

                                     **THE PURPOSE OF COURSE**

                For this is his decree in this stage of slateness he, or she? is in. Let it be known
                that for ALL of the Following I the author did Loudly speak each of those for words
                in an upbeat jaunty voice that might be written imformally as "THE (with weight.)
                Porpus ovf Coorssse!" and in this case the `!` is included in the statement. 
                It is after all...          The Purpose,

THE DILIGENT READER.                                ....of course /

                                                              And NOW the play begins.

LORD G. The Purpose of Course! Do you yourself ENDORSE?

        mean it this way. For I know not the plan, I simple DEMAND the ENDORSE YOUR PURPOSE TODAY!
        It is my blackend decree, that I've made on mine on knee, you shall ENDORSE TODAY! I've
        simply decided that I must do a thing -- the extent of which in mighty unclear. But alas!
        Like a needle on a thread -- or a thread of an idea -- I have the root of it. That my friend
        is Clear. 

        I know what it is it is hear/re:

        I Officially wish to craft mine on wish! For who else to do it but me `.` For know that the
        Period is ME. My wish is to make a pursit of the highest degree I could attain, it is
        knowledge I seek, though I am sometimes meek. I beg of you -- dont peak ;  
    LOOK OUT! DOWN BELOW! Thank God you're not hurt, I'd feared the worst when I saw the artillary
        'interlocutor - NEW WORD ALERT!!!!!'      <- beside! I know not where I can hide some prose
                                                   look it is a very of version of my distracted
    self. I Beleive he must have found it important to bomb us with paste and say, maybe the word
      interlocutor has somthing to do with...
        
YOU.                                    The Purpose?

Lord G.                                                 Of Course! Thank you for reminding me to get
        my way; the accident is behind us and with all that behind let us get back to the matter at
        hand. That was Of Course?

YOU.                                The Purpose?

Lord G.                                           Of Course! Will I ever find a way to say!?
        The Purpose of Course! is... -- allow me a moment to refer to my notes...

YOU.                        Of Course!                                            of course.

                                                                 Exit Up Lord G.

You.          The Purpose?

                              Lord G. Returns from above...

You.                                                            Of Course!

Lord G. Guess what my friend, I have accomplished my goal to learn, for I learned I saught knowledge
        as far into the past as above. Knowledge, the pursit of, a commendable goal don't you agree?

Lord G. Winks, and transforms into suitible attire to portray a role from the piece of prose he was
        in the middle of writing when he thought to bomb the set of ACT I. SCENE I.

The Right Honorable Narrator.                       Let us not forget how lucky we are to have
                                                    heard tell from such a learned g, he was of
                                                    course an all around Capital Act!

Lord G. The Purpose...                      ...Yes lad, in good time! 

YOU.                of...       ...course?

Lord G. Is idealy defined as a written record, to be kept for all time. The purpose of which is
        two-fold in one hand this record begins like many do with a thread with the very earnest
        hope that this one, betters me instead -- specifically, it is through the studious labour of
        doing that I wish to temper my tounge, let me dear YOU be a Vomitorium.

        The second fold, or had you forgot?           
You.                                        Of Course!

Lord G.                                               Not! I knew it, see you already know that you
        my dear fellow, are simply a tool for me, that is right, ME! the Lord G. 

        That second fold, that just got away -- actually has something significant to say. This
        second fold hides a crease. If a man is a sum of his words, then his willful, WRITTEN words
        are worth of a handsome bargin, to the right buyer -- of course.

YOU.                                                                    Of course. The

Lord G.                                                                                Lord, you are 
        quite correct! If an Epitaph gambles to live up to it's name, it would be a summary of all
        that made up a life, briefly, sisinctly, and hopefully beautifully. So the sum of any weaver
        of words could hope their body of written labour could do for the registering in the minds
        of other's his very presence on terra firma. 

        For if the world came so to be \
        as I hope earnestly to see \
        then the pure recollection of humanity \
        Will be plenty good for me! \

        Sincerly yours,
        I have been a moment in time with the hopefully humble Lord G., who frankly wishes he was a
        bigger fan of tea.                                  Is that..
